# Customer Support Agent Enhancement Design Document

## Overview
This document outlines proposed enhancements to the Claude Customer Support Agent application to improve user experience and leverage the latest Claude capabilities.

## Business Context
Customer support interactions increasingly require:
- Access to the latest AI model capabilities for improved response quality
- Better formatting of technical responses including code snippets and structured data
- Visual context for troubleshooting issues through screenshot sharing

## Proposed Features

### 1. Claude Model Updates & Enhanced Model Selection

**Problem**: The application currently uses older Claude model versions and lacks clear visibility of available models.

**Solution**: Update to the latest Claude models and improve the model selection interface:
- Update to Claude 4 Sonnet (claude-sonnet-4-20250514) as the default model
- Update to Claude 3.5 Haiku (claude-3-5-haiku-20241022) for fast responses
- Display model descriptions in the dropdown to help users choose appropriately
- Show model capabilities (speed vs. capability trade-offs)

**Technical Requirements**:
- Update model IDs in ChatArea.tsx
- Enhance dropdown UI to show model descriptions
- Add tooltips explaining each model's strengths
- Implement model capability indicators (speed/quality badges)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Latest Claude models are available and functional
- Users can see model descriptions before selection
- Model switching is seamless without losing conversation context
- Default model is set to Claude 4 Sonnet

### 2. Markdown Rendering for AI Responses

**Problem**: AI responses containing code snippets, lists, tables, and formatted text appear as plain text, making them hard to read.

**Solution**: Implement full markdown rendering for AI responses:
- Render code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Support tables, lists, and nested formatting
- Properly display bold, italic, and inline code
- Add copy buttons for code blocks
- Support clickable links

**Technical Requirements**:
- Integrate react-markdown (already in dependencies)
- Configure rehype-highlight for syntax highlighting (already in dependencies)
- Add custom CSS for markdown elements
- Implement code block copy functionality
- Ensure proper sanitization for security

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All markdown elements render correctly
- Code blocks have syntax highlighting and copy buttons
- Links are clickable but open in new tabs
- Formatting matches the application's design system
- No XSS vulnerabilities from markdown rendering

### 3. Screenshot Upload for Issue Reporting

**Problem**: Users often struggle to describe visual issues or UI problems in text, leading to longer resolution times.

**Solution**: Allow users to upload screenshots directly in the chat:
- Drag-and-drop or click-to-upload interface
- Image preview before sending
- Automatic image compression for performance
- Support for common formats (PNG, JPG, GIF)
- Integration with Claude's vision capabilities

**Technical Requirements**:
- File upload component with drag-and-drop support
- Client-side image compression
- Base64 encoding for API transmission
- Update message interface to support image attachments
- Modify API to handle multimodal inputs

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Users can upload images via drag-and-drop or file picker
- Images are previewed before sending
- Large images are automatically compressed
- Claude can analyze uploaded images
- Upload progress indicator is shown
- File size limit of 5MB is enforced

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Model Updates (Week 1)
- Update model configurations
- Enhance dropdown UI with descriptions
- Test model switching functionality
- Update documentation

### Phase 2: Markdown Rendering (Week 2)
- Integrate react-markdown component
- Configure syntax highlighting
- Style markdown elements
- Add copy functionality for code blocks
- Security testing

### Phase 3: Screenshot Upload (Weeks 3-4)
- Build upload UI component
- Implement image compression
- Update API for multimodal support
- Integration testing
- User acceptance testing

## Success Metrics
- Model selection clarity: 90% of users understand model differences
- Response readability: 40% reduction in clarification requests for technical responses
- Issue resolution time: 25% faster for visual/UI issues
- User satisfaction: Increase from 4.2 to 4.5 stars

## Technical Considerations
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing conversations
- Maintain responsive design across all screen sizes
- Keep bundle size minimal despite new features
- Implement progressive enhancement for older browsers

## Security Considerations
- Sanitize all markdown content to prevent XSS
- Validate and scan uploaded images
- Implement file type restrictions
- Add rate limiting for image uploads
- Ensure images are not stored permanently without user consent

## Open Questions
1. Should we support file formats beyond images (PDF, documents)?
2. What's the maximum image size we should support?
3. Should markdown rendering be toggleable by users?
4. Do we need image annotation features?

## Next Steps
1. Update model configurations and test latest Claude versions
2. Create UI mockups for enhanced model dropdown
3. Prototype markdown rendering with existing conversations
4. Design image upload component
5. Security review of proposed changes
